                        <p>I think one of the biggest things I've learned throughout my apprenticeship is that it's not just about how good you are at data, you also need to maintain good relatioships with people. You need to have the ability to explain what data means in a way that all can understand.</p>

                        <p>The mose important thing when we were discussing development options was that the apprenticeship we put in ront of Barry was a good package - it was exactly what Barry was doing within their role. We could see it was going to give them lots of development opportunities and it felt like a good fit.</p>
